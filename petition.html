                            Marcos has not dismantled Duterte’s “drug war”. Policemen together with their associates keep on arresting people using warrants issued by the former president. The president’s official figure for deaths related to the ‘drug war’ from July 1, 2016 to May 31, 2022 is 6,252 people; thousands of others died at the hands of unidentified gunmen. The Philippine government has not included current figures into its statistics since May 2022.

                                The figure of killings has decreased in general since June 30, 2022, when Marcos came into power; however, the killings are still happening. The University of the Philippines Third World Studies Center tracking noted that there were more drug related killings during the first year of Marcos than in the last year of Duterte. While leading Ilocos, 471 people were killed in anti-drug operations, both by police and by unknown gunmen, as of November 15 this year. Again, as with the previous cases most of these stays unsolved. For instance in Davao City, which based on the University of the Philippines statistics is among the top cities in drug related killings, the police have been implicated in most killings.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Most of the extra-judicial killings have occurred during politically affiliated violence especially around election times. Of March 4, some armed men who are reportedly former military personnel attacked and killed Degamo, the governor of Negros Oriental province and nine other persons. The massacre has linked one political opponent for what has been described as the worst case of political violence in the Philippines since the Maguindanao Massacre in 2009.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Journalists also have received attention from Marcos by wherein 4 journalist have been killed already under his command And the total death toll since the restoration of democracy in 1986 is 177. The last one who was killed was Cresenciano Bunduquin, a broadcast journalist from the Oriental Mindoro province, killed on the evening of May 31. The murder of Percy Mabasa who was a popular radio commentator occurred in October 2022 to date key suspects have not been apprehended.

                                He has complained that insurgency-related killings have significantly escalated, especially in the province of Negros in the country’s western Visayas region that has been one of the Red’s erstwhile recruiting grounds. In June, two people, including a couple, and their two children were killed by infamous gunmen in Negros Occidental; The military accused the couple of being involved in the New People’s Army NPA.

                                The security forces have also killed children in this operations. Again in August, Jemboy Baltazar, 17, was shot dead by police where witness say police searched for illegal drugs in Baltazar’s body to justify the shooting. John Frances Ompad, 17, was also shot dead by a police officer in August.

                            Reports of “red-tagging” by the authorities and their aides and pro-ruling administration media were again noted. Red tagging is always a precursor to physical elimination, thus threatening activist and shrinking democratic space further. The government actors have red-tagged activists, unionists, environment proponents, Indigenous people, educators, students, and media practitioners.

                                May saw the hosts of a pro--government programme attacking the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines and its chair, Jonathan de Santos, as being in league with the communists. In June some activists and environmental defenders in the northern Philippines had fled to the Supreme Court after being marked as terrorists by the militar} Some victims of red-tagging are bringing lawsuits in response: On July also Carol Araullo, a noted leftist activist for many years filed a case of red-tagging against the hosts of a progovernment TV program. Her son, the journalist Atom Araullo, filed his case in September along with her.

                                Sometimes, the red-tagging has evolved into ‘terrorist’-tagging, where the government implements the country’s severe and ambiguous Anti-Terror Act against civil society institutions, accusing them of financing terrorists. September encountered another controversy when the military accused CERNET, a central Philippines based NGO for supporting the terrorist New People’s Army through providing funds.

                                The harassment of unions and labor activists was the center of a,top-level mission of the International Labour Organisation in January. The mission condemned red-tagging and other forms of harassment against trade unionists. April saw President Marcos signing the Executive Order 23 which gives assurances to workers against oppression and lays down its policy to recognize the workers’ freedom to form organizations.

                                The that had been said was not all bad news though. Amnesty International, that has recognized her as a political prisoner, was political prisoner Leila de Lima, former senator who was released in November when the last drug case filed by the Duterte administration against her was dismissed on her bail. She was arrested and detained almost seven years ago on a sane reprehensible charges of the drug dealer. September saw a Manila court dismissing charges of tax evasion against Nobel Peace Prize recipient Maria Ressa of Rappler; she, and others still face two more cases in court.

                                During his visit to the Philippines in April, EU Special Representative on Human Rights, Eamon Gilmore noted poor follow up on the Filipino government’s compliance to the GSP+ commitments on human rights and pointed that “working with the EU means dealing with human rights.” Some of the European Parliamentarians did retain their skepticism about the Philippine government’s commitment to improvement in the human rights situation and challenged the competence of the country to be part of GSP+.

                                Late August, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen visited Manila and applauded the Marcos regime for altering the direction in the human rights condition in the country. Von der Leyen said that she asked the EU Trade Commissioner to start new negotiations for an FTA that were put on hold by Duterte due to the human rights violations. In November, the EU issues report on human rights situation in Philippines as per condition for GSP+ saying major rights records remain weak but more need to be done.

                                Newly established in 2020, the UNJP has also focused on developing the capacity of institutional accountability frameworks in the country. Despite having conducted awareness, capacity building and recommended the training of law enforcers on proper methods in investigating rights abuses the UNJP has had a minimal positive impact due to the Covid-19 outbreak or non-support from the Philippine government at first.
